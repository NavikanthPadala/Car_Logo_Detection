**Car Logo Detection**
**Overview**

This project implements a CNN-based Car Logo Detection Model that achieves 92% accuracy. The model is trained on 10k+ pre-processed images with data augmentation to improve generalization.

**Features**

Detects and classifies car logos from input images.

Uses OpenCV for preprocessing and feature extraction.

Scalable and robust for real-world datasets.

Trained on multiple car brands for reliable classification.

**Tech Stack**

Python, TensorFlow/Keras – Model training and inference

OpenCV – Image preprocessing (resizing, filtering, feature extraction)

NumPy, Pandas – Data handling

**Dataset**

Contains over 10,000 car logo images across different brands.

Augmentation techniques used: rotation, flipping, scaling, brightness adjustments.

**Results**

Achieved 92% test accuracy.

Works well under varied lighting and backgrounds
